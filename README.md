Introduction

In this course, you'll learn how to build dynamic and responsive web applications. Starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development, you'll then move on to back-end technologies like Node.js, Express, and databases (such as MongoDB or SQL). The course will also introduce you to front-end frameworks like React.js, Vue.js, or Angular, and youâ€™ll learn how to use version control with Git.

The goal is to equip you with the knowledge to create fully functional, modern websites and web applications that work across different devices and platforms.
